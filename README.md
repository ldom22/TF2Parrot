# TF2Parrot
A program that detects and records voice talk in TF2 and replays it for fun/mocking

Requirements:
- TF2 obviously
- Microphone
- Speakers

Headset is not recommended as it records voice directly from speakers.

Note: while it is fun, abuse is not recommended. I have been kicked out of games myself.
I recommend to disable the automatic 'v' key and manually use v when you hear the desired mocked voice.

Tested so far in:
- MAC OS X with screen resolution of 1366x768

If it does not work on your PC please report an issue and include your operating system and screen resolution.
